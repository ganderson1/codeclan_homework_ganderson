1. How many books per language
2. How many books per author
3. Average rating per author
   Number of ratings per author
4. Correlation between number of pages and number of ratings
5.Text review, number of ratings and average rating


# Cleaning dataset

 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
#load dataset
books_raw <- read.csv("data/books.csv")
#clean dataset
books_clean  %>% 
  #Select columns needed
  select("title", "authors", "average_rating", "language_code", "num_pages", "ratings_count", "text_reviews_count") #%>% 
  #convert average_rating back to double (changed in csv whilst having problems loading books.csv)
  mutate(books_clean, average_rating = average_rating / 100)

#  
unique(books_raw$language_code)
glimpse(books_clean)


```
# 1 How many books per language



```{r}
#group books by language then sum totals. Used unique() to check variable types
books_by_lang<- select(books_clean, language_code) %>% 
  group_by(language_code) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE, name = "No. of books")
books_by_lang
```

# 2 How many books per author (English only)


(filtered to only english ("eng, "en-US", "en-GB", "en-CA") for simplicity)
```{r}
books_by_author <- select(books_clean, authors, language_code) %>% 
  #select only books that have englishas language from language code ()
  filter(language_code %in% c("eng", "en-US", "en-GB", "en-CA")) %>% 
  group_by(authors) %>% 
  tally(sort = TRUE, name = "No. of books")
books_by_author

```

# 3 Average rating per author

```{r}
ave_rating_table <- select(books_clean, authors, average_rating) %>% 
  #group by author
  group_by(authors) %>%                         
  # add average rating for all books by each other then create average rating for each author
  summarise_at(vars("average_rating"),              
               list(total_average_rating = mean)) %>% 
  arrange(ave_rating_table, (total_average_rating / 100))
ave_rating
```
# 4 Correlation between number of pages and number of ratings

Do people not finish longer books, leading to lower ratings




```{r}
books_filter_ratings <- books_clean %>% 
  #ignore >1000 ratings
  filter(ratings_count > 1000) %>% 
  #ignore text reviews under 10
  filter(text_reviews_count > 10)

books_filter_ratings

attach(books_filter_ratings)
plot(ratings_count, num_pages, main="Scatterplot Example",
   xlab="no. of ratings ", ylab="no. of pages", pch=19)

attach(books_filter_ratings)
plot(text_reviews_count, num_pages, main="Scatterplot Example",
   xlab="no. of text reviews", ylab="no. of pages", pch=19)
```

# 5 Text review, number of ratings and average rating

Any correlation between number of text reviews, number of ratings and average rating?

Couldn't get to work. Think I've removed values from average_rating so that  x!= y
```{r}
attach(books_filter_ratings)
plot(ratings_count, average_rating, main="",
   xlab="no. of ratings ", ylab="no. of pages", pch=19)

attach(books_1000)
plot(text_reviews_count, average_rating, main="Scatterplot Example",
   xlab="no. of text reviews", ylab="no. of pages", pch=19)
```
