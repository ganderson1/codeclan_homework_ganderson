2 MVP and Extension - Probability problems

1. 

probability of number less than 5

4/6 ~ 2/3 ~ 0.66667


2.
```{r}
rolldie(3)
```
216

3.
i
```{r}
die_4 <- rolldie(4)
die_4
```

```{r}

total_equals_5_6_7 <- die_4 %>%
  filter(X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 7 | X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 6 | X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 5)


total_equals_5_6_7 %>%
  summarise(size_of_event_space = n())
```
ii
```{r}
34/1296
```

iii
assuming ordering of the die is unimportant (ie x1=2, x2=1, x3=1, x4=1 is not same as x1=1, x2=2, x3=1, x4=1)

4
```{r}
permutations(
    n = 5, 
    r = 5, 
     
    repeats.allowed = FALSE)
```

120 in sample space but only 2 that are 1,2,3,4,5 or 5,4,3,2,1
```{r}
2/120

```
